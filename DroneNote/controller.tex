A proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller is a feedback control loop mechanism. The aim is to reach a givenreference value (called set point) for the intput by regulating its output. The output $u(t)$ of the controller is thesum of three terms that are proportional conrrespondingly to the error $e(t)$ (P term), the integral of the error (Iterm) and the derivative of the error (D term). Each term is multiplied by a gain, $K_P$,$K_I$ and $K_D$ respectively,that will give their relative importance and fix the properties of the controller: overshoot, reactivity, stability.\begin{equation}	u(t) = K_P e(t) + K_I\int_0^t{e(\tau)d\tau} + K_D \frac{de(t)}{dt}\end{equation}The P term can be interpreted as a reponse to a perturbation. It is subject to a steady state error that reduces when$K_P$ rises. But increasing $K_P$ also enhances the oscillations of the system. Adding the I term removes the steadystate error as its action continue to affect the output as long as a stable state on the set point has not beenreached. The time to reach the set point is reduced when the gain of the integral term is increased but as for theproportional term it also enhances the oscillations and overshoots. Finally the derivative term acts as a predictiveterm by linear interpolation that help damping the oscillations%TODO high pass and low pass filters for the derivative term (see astrom-ch6)%TODO address integral windup%TODO address derivative kick%TODO feed forward when changing the setpoint%TODO think about a cascaded PID : the first controls the torque, the second control the motor: % motor_response = PID(measured_torque, PID(sensor, setpoint));%TODO look at the different forms of PID for optimisationThe controller described hereafter is able to drive the drone towards the desired attitude and linear velocity, the setpoints for this application. The inputs of the controller are the measurements of angular rates, linear velocity andattitude quaternion. The output are the torque and thrust that need to be applied on the model.  This goal is reached by cascading two PID controllers. The first one is controlling the linear velocity of the model,using it as an input. As the quadricopter is not able to produce a thrust in any direction but only along its z axis,acting on the acceleration in any other direction can only be achieved by rotating the body frame z axis in theinertial frame. The control on the acceleration is then realized by acting on the total thrust and the orientation ofthe z axis in the inertial frame. The error $\v{v}_e$ is defined as the difference between the reference velocity$\v{v}_{Ref}$ and the measured velocity $\v{v}_m$\begin{equation}	\v{v}_{err} = \v{v}_{Ref} - \v{v}_m\end{equation}%TODO adapt this with the real PID when implemented The total thrust in the inertial frame is proportional to this error but the effect of the gravity has to be taken into account and a constant term is added (feed-forward). Only the disturbance with respect to gravity are taken into account by this controller. \begin{equation} 	\v{T}_{out} = \v{v}_{err} - \v{g} \end{equation}This thrust and the quaternion representing the rotation needed to move the body z axis onto the thrust direction arethe output of this controller and are used as set point for the second.

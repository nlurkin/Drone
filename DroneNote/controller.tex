The control of the model is done through a proportional-integral-derivative(PID) controller. It is a feedback loop mechanism able to drive the dronetowards the desired setpoint: attitude, speed, position. The controller usesthe available input measurements (angular speeds, linear speeds, attitudequaternion) and computes an error with respect to the desired setpoint andadapts the output (torque and thrust) in order to reduce the error. Eachof the control term has a different effect. The gain The P term is proportionalto the current error - Adaptative
